1) Install node.js
2) install express and gulp globally: npm install express -g, npm install gulp -g
3) run npm install in projet dir
4) run gulp build to build files
5) run gulp watch so js is compiled on each save

If adding new file, gulp fails to detect its changes so Ctrl + c to stop gulp from watching fs and run gulp watch again

use pm run <task name> from Projfile to generate spritesheet with .json
